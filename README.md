# 🐍 Two-Player Snake Game (.NET Framework)

> 🕒 **Note:** This project was originally developed in **September 2021** and uploaded to GitHub in **October 2025** for portfolio and documentation purposes.

This desktop game was built using **C# and .NET Framework**, designed to recreate the classic Snake experience with a competitive twist. Two players can control separate snakes on the same board, racing to collect food and avoid collisions.

The system includes:

- 🎮 **Two-Player Mode** – Each player controls a snake using separate keys  
- 🍎 **Food Generation** – Randomized food placement with score tracking  
- 💥 **Collision Detection** – Game over on wall or snake collision  
- 🕹️ **Real-Time Movement** – Smooth gameplay using timers and key events  
- 🎨 **Custom UI** – Designed with Windows Forms and GDI+ graphics  
- 🌐 **Persian Language UI** – Interface localized for Farsi-speaking users
